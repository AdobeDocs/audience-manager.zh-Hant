# 外部裝置圖表使用案例 {#external-device-graph-use-cases}

Recommendations和使用外部設備圖表為未知用戶查找、重新定位和個性化的用例。 外部設備圖被定義為與Audience Manager分離的設備圖。 這包括整合Adobe與第三方確定性或概率設備圖形公司的整合。

## 建議 {#recommendations}

考慮以下市場活動的第三方設備圖表選項：

* 對其數字屬性進行低級別的身份驗證。 使用 [!UICONTROL Profile Link Device Graph option] 如果您有大量經過身份驗證的用戶。
* 瞄準大量觀眾。 第三方設備圖形包含經過驗證和未經過驗證的資料。
* 在個人和家庭一級對訪客進行認證和/或未經認證。

## Prospecting/Branding Use Case {#prospecting-branding-use-cases}

A branding campaign is designed to reach as many people as possible. It places few limits on segment qualification. But, these campaigns can waste budget and impressions by constantly targeting people who see your content multiple times and don't convert. A [!UICONTROL Profile Merge] rule that uses the [!DNL Device Co-op] or third-party option can help you create an efficient branding campaign. For example, you can add these unknown users to a "not in-market" segment after seeing them across multiple devices for your set frequency cap.

## Retargeting or Site Personalization Use Case {#retargeting-use-case}

These strategies are designed to bring an unauthenticated or unknown user back to your site or personalize their browsing experience while they're on-site.

<!-- ## Expanded Device Targeting {#audience-expansion}

This use case exemplifies how you can expand the size of your addressable audience with accurate cross-device personalization, through [!DNL External Device Graphs].

Let's say Jane owns three devices that she uses regularly to search for holiday package deals: her laptop ([!DNL Device 1]), her smartphone ([!DNL Device 2]), and her tablet ([!DNL Device 3]). While using the laptop, Jane searched for flights, hotels, and guided tours. While using the smartphone and tablet, she only visited the homepage of the travel agency.

By using the [!UICONTROL No Cross-Device Profile] + [!DNL External Device Graphs] rule, the travel agency can merge all three devices profiles, since they are linked to the same owner through the [!DNL External Device Graphs].

![audience-expansion-rule](assets/audience-expansion-rule.png)

In our example, the traits required to qualify for the segment have all been collected on [!DNL Device 1]. Since Audience Manager qualifies every device profile that took part in the profile merge for a segment, all of Jane's three device profiles are now segmented.

Through this rule, the device graph has expanded the number of device profiles which qualify for the segment from one to three and has enabled the travel agency to deliver a consistent message to all three devices owned by Jane.

## 高級跨設備目標 {#advanced-graph-expansion}

此使用案例說明如何通過使用外部設備圖表擴展用戶目標，以通過 **[!UICONTROL Last Authenticated Profiles]** + **[!UICONTROL Profile Link Device Graph]** 規則。

![最後設備圖](assets/last-profile-link.png)

在下面的示例中，Acme Inc.公司希望將收入超過每年100.000美元的所有家庭作為目標， [!DNL Acme Inc.] 訂閱者 [!DNL Data Plan A]，使用 [!DNL iPhone 7] 設備。

John在資料計畫A上使用其iPhone7在Acme Inc.網站上進行身份驗證。 同時，約翰的 [!DNL Profile Link Device Graph] 群集包含他經常使用的另外兩個設備：他的筆記型電腦[!DNL Device 1])和他的二級智慧手機， [!DNL Device 2] (a) [!DNL Samsung S7] 上 [!DNL Data Plan B])。

使用 **[!UICONTROL Last Authenticated Profiles]** + **[!UICONTROL Profile Link Device Graph]**。 [!DNL Acme Inc.] 能夠從John的設備圖形群集向所有三台設備傳遞個性化消息，儘管其中只有一台最初符合該段的條件。
